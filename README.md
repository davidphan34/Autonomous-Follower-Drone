# Autonomous Follower Drone
In collaboration with the Navy, we were tasked with programming one drone to follow another drone within a set threshold distance.
We achieved this through programming a Parrot  AR Drone to follow a Raspberry Pi through calculating the distance and heading through their given GPS data.
Coded in Node.js
